#200. Num of Islands

# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

#Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

#------------

#is graph problem?
    #connecting ajacent lands, horizontal and vertically
    # yes 2d grid map
    # each cell is node and edges betwen up down left gith

# what teaversal?
 #count components
 # bfs to spread out and build the full island

# what extensions?
    # 2d grid dealing wiht 2d coordinates 1/j

# code is up
    # build graph to get neighbors?
    #no we csn get neighbors by checking up down left right

    #outer loop? mutiple traversals
        #yes
    #code base BFS, then extension (getting neighbor is diferernt)
