#valid tree if: no cycles and connected


#1 can it be modeled as graph problem?
    #yes graph valid tree
#2 what traversal will help us?
    #connect component = 1
    #no cycle
#3 extension, cycle detection
#4 code it up -> do we need to build graph
    #do we need to build the graph(better data structure
        #edge list -> adj list
    # mutiple traversals?
        # yes visit every node, make aure only 1 connect component
    #code up (DFS)
        #then add cycle detection
#BFS
